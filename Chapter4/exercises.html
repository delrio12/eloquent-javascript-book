        <h2 class='task-name'>4.1 The Sum of a Range</h2>
        <p class='task-description'>
            The introduction of this book alluded to the following as a nice way to compute the sum of a range of numbers:
            <br><br>
            <code>
                console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
            </code>
            <br><br>
            Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to and including end.
            <br><br>
            Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers. Run the example program and see whether it does indeed return 55.
            <br><br>
            As a bonus assignment, modify your range function to take an optional third argument that indicates the “step” value used when building the array. If no step is given, the elements should go up by increments of one, corresponding to the old behavior. The function call range(1, 10, 2) should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Make sure this also works with negative step values so that range(5, 2, -1) produces [5, 4, 3, 2].
        </p>
        <h2 class='task-name'>4.2 Reversing an array</h2>
        <p class='task-description'>"Arrays have a method reverse, which changes the array by inverting the order in which its elements appear. For this exercise, write two functions, reverseArray and reverseArrayInPlace. The first, reverseArray, takes an array as argument and produces a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order. The second, reverseArrayInPlace, does what the reverse method does: it modifies the array given as argument in order to reverse its elements. Neither may use the standard reverse method. <br>Thinking back to the notes about side effects and pure functions in the previous chapter, which variant do you expect to be useful in more situations? Which one is more efficient?"</p>
